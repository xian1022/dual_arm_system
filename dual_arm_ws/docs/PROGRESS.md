# Development status — 2026-11-13

Current status by work package is in MODIFICATION_PLAN.md section 6. Each section below records one result at the time it was made, so later sections supersede what older ones list as not run.

## Latest result: sync with the two upstream repos (prototype first)

- 2026-11-13. User decision: work on the prototype mode for now and keep in step with Azeem1010/Dual-Arm-TEST-2.0 and Azeem1010/env_camera_vision. All branches were read; only two carried new work.
- Dual-Arm-TEST-2.0 `e0-esp32-suction` (`3a90ba2`, `6fb080a`, the E0 result below) was fast-forwarded onto main. Its `env-scene-debug-image` branch was already merged (`52a6518`); `main` holds the 11-10/11-11 field records imported in `d2ddfae` (photos and large logs stay there); `orin-source` is an Orin snapshot whose `src` equals `3fd258c`, nothing to take.
- env_camera_vision `main` = `calib/c-slot-positions` = `6b3d5c1`: C slot rows y 45/10/-25/-60 mm from a field ruler measurement (slot 1 front edge 75 mm; the grid sits 5 mm toward the user from the simulation). Submodule and `src/env_scene/scene_core.py` updated, the local debug-image change kept; sources.lock.json updated. Upstream still uses the field centre as origin: the black-frame field version mentioned on 11-12 was never pushed.
- Prototype `c_slots_xy_m` now uses the measured rows; simulation keeps 0.050/0.015/-0.020/-0.055, strict hardware stays null. Coordinator reads only occupancy by slot index from env_scene, so the placement coordinates come from this file.
- Checks: see evidence/sync_20261113/.

## Earlier result: E0 ESP32 suction check on the Orin

- 2026-11-13, physical (evidence/hardware/20261113_E0/). The ESP32 had an older single-cup firmware (`esp32_suction_node`, `/suction_cmd` Bool); reflashed from ray000518/micro-ros `0c28c7f` with a local pin change for the new wiring (pump/valve 12/13 and 25/26; upstream is still 4/5/18/19). ORIN_DEPLOYMENT 6.1 gives the reflash steps.
- PASS: echoes for 1–4; commands 1/2 act on arm1 and 3/4 on arm2; both cups hold a cap in about 1 s (on-site estimate) and drop it on release; no pump or valve movement on two boots (GPIO12 is a strapping pin). FAIL: after a power loss the ESP32 does not reconnect until the agent is restarted (firmware tries once).
- hardware/coordinator.yaml gripper is now complete: `esp32_modules` arm1 1 / arm2 2, `vacuum_settle_s` 2.0, `esp32_echo_timeout_s` 2.0, `reply_timeout_s` 60.0 (operator confirm time, chosen by the developer at the user's request). Prototype `vacuum_settle_s` 1.0 → 2.0.

## Earlier result: hardware prototype mode

- User decision (2026-11-13): run the whole flow on the real arms now (detect, plan, pick in A, hand over in B, place in C); accuracy and suction success are not required; the only e-stop is the CM-530 power switch and there is no time for more wiring, so D8 is not built. Design and plan: superpowers/specs/2026-11-13-hardware-prototype-mode-design.md, superpowers/plans/2026-11-13-hardware-prototype-mode.md.
- New coordinator `mode: prototype` (`evidence_kind: prototype_estimate`, calibration HOME, suction may be auto-confirmed); strict `hardware` stays BLOCKED. Three estimated files headed `PROTOTYPE ESTIMATE`: `cm530_hardware/config/calibration_prototype.yaml` (runtime.json zeros and directions, URDF raw limits, `max_step_raw` 20), `dual_arm_controllers/config/controllers_prototype.yaml` (loose tolerances), `dual_arm_coordinator/config/prototype/coordinator.yaml` (simulation layout, speeds 0.3, esp32 suction auto-confirmed, modules guessed). AGENTS.md records the exception.
- `hardware.launch.py` gains `require_estop` (default true). New `hardware_prototype.launch.py` (arms, vision, coordinator with `observation_source=env_scene`, `require_safety=false`). Operator UI mode 實機 Prototype, detected from the prototype calibration in the description, opens start, HOME and reset and shows a PROTOTYPE banner.
- Checks and evidence: evidence/prototype_mode_20261113/. Real arms NOT_RUN; a prototype run never counts as an H stage PASS.

## Earlier result: camera roles for the USB bandwidth limit

- 2026-11-13 (`52a6518`, made on the Orin, from Azeem1010/Dual-Arm-TEST-2.0 `env-scene-debug-image`): `env_scene_node` publishes its OpenCV overlay on `/vision/env/debug_image` (`publish_debug_image`, default true, also when the field is not found), so the operator UI shows the annotated env view on hardware instead of the raw image. `vision_hardware.launch.py` gains `show_debug` (OpenCV window, default false) and `publish_debug_image`; the vision_pkg include is scoped so its `show_debug:=false` no longer overrides env_scene. This is a local change to the imported `src/env_scene`, not upstream yet. Orin: overlay ~7 fps; Windows WSL rebuild and the 10 env_scene tests PASS (evidence/env_debug_image_20261113/).
- User decisions (2026-11-12): the environment camera decides zones A, B and C; the arm cameras only monitor and must never stream together, switching with the moving arm (process start/stop, design option A); no end-to-end hardware dry-run mode; caps go only inside the black-taped visible part of zone A (operating rule). Design and plan: superpowers/specs/2026-11-12-camera-roles-design.md, superpowers/plans/2026-11-12-camera-roles.md.
- Coordinator: arm 2 picks zone B at an observed position (`TaskIO.b_pick_target`, refused beyond `zones.b_pick_tolerance_m`, simulation 0.02 m, hardware null); new `observation_source=env_scene` (`gateways/env_scene.py`) maps the env_scene world coordinates and refuses `estimated` coordinates and invalid flags per use; zone B arm clearance from joint feedback. Simulation still uses truth / vision_pick and picks B at `b_place`.
- `vision.launch.py` starts at most one arm camera (`arm_camera:=none|arm1|arm2`, default none). New `arm_camera_switch` and `env_scene_bridge` in `dual_arm_vision_adapter`, new `dual_arm_bringup/vision_hardware.launch.py`; the operator UI's hardware mode uses it and shows the rotation (「輪流中，鏡頭關閉」, 「僅監控」).
- env_camera_vision imported at `6b059eb` with the user's consent (GitHub's only version); the field version (zone A coordinates from the black frame) must replace it once pushed. Build and the upstream 10 tests PASS. env_scene answers with its latest result and debounces C slots over 3 results, so the coordinator waits `SCENE_LAG_S` = 0.5 s past the arms settling before it queries.
- 2026-11-12 whole-project check (`docs/evidence/project_check_20261112/`): everything PASS except the known `smoke_runtime_sim` shutdown timeout and one intermittent `operator_tools` miss (no joint state within 20 s), which passed on rerun. Review minors fixed in `b78065e`; `device_in_use` still needs all camera processes under one user. Interface and deployment docs now name `vision_hardware.launch.py` and the new nodes.
- NOT_RUN: everything on the Orin (HARDWARE_TEST_GUIDE V1). Tests and tier runs: TEST_REPORT and evidence/camera_roles_20261112/.

## Earlier result: slot 8 with a tilted cup; system audit; Orin update steps

- User decisions (2026-11-12): relax "cup straight down" so the simulation fills all 8 slots; raise tilted contact targets; move the simulated cap_8; axis offset 5 mm; leave the simulated cameras (D7).
- IK tries straight down first; otherwise it allows a tilt up to `motion.max_tool_tilt_deg` (simulation 9°, the real slot-8 teach was about 8.7°) and takes the solution nearest the current joints. The smallest-tilt solution leans the shoulder into the base in MoveIt; the chosen branch is the one the real arm used. The motion gateway raises tilted contact targets by the cup rim (empty) or the held cap rim plus the pick lift (holding). The Gazebo suction plugin accepts 10° and 2 mm vertical. New hardware fields `heights.cup_radius_m` and `motion.max_tool_tilt_deg` are null until measured.
- Simulated cap_8 starts at (-0.24, 0.05): its slot-mirror position needs a tilted pick, and a cap picked tilted shifted about 1 mm when put down at B. Arm axes, C slots and cap starts now come from `scripts/field_layout.py` (was six copies).
- PASS: t1 (IK 18/18), coordinator 293, HMI 293, vision 100, gripper gtest, batch fills all 8 slots, faults, two, motion gateway, operator tools, vision pick (0.70 mm). evidence/tilt_slot8_20261112/.
- System audit (evidence/system_audit_20261112/): live graph of `hmi_sim` with the operator UI nodes has no type, QoS or missing-server problem; 10 subscriptions without a publisher are optional by design. `run_checks.sh` now blocks on and fails for leftover coordinator, safety, vision and TF processes; a stale coordinator had invalidated one run. Known: a service reply right after a coordinator restart can be lost (ROS_INTERFACES gap 11).
- Orin: the `orin-source` branch of Azeem1010/Dual-Arm-TEST-2.0 has the same tree as `3fd258c` (no local code changes). ORIN_DEPLOYMENT "從舊版更新" gives the pull steps; the imported field records exist on the Orin as untracked files and must be moved aside first.

## Earlier result: phase C, measured field geometry and slot numbering

- Simulation now follows the 2026-11-11 measurements: board 600 × 240 mm, j1 axes at world (±0.10, 0.125) about 5 mm outside the arm-side edge, C slots numbered as on the real board (1 and 2 nearest the arms, odd column next to B at x 0.135, even at 0.170; rows y 0.050 / 0.015 / -0.020 / -0.055), cap starts at the mirrored slots, B place point (0, 0). `prefilled_slots` defaults to 0; the HMI slot grid puts slot 1 top-left; `vision_pkg` gained `slot_one_corner` (`top_left` in the hardware arm2 config). Details and run history: evidence/phase_c_20261111/README.md.
- Simulated arm cameras moved from x ±0.20 to ±0.15, over the cap and slot groups: arm1 calibration error 1.15 mm → 0.70 mm (budget 1 mm, not widened). The camera static TF in `sim.launch.py` still had the old left/right order and was corrected.
- Tests that hard-coded the old layout were updated (motion gateway, operator tools, legacy pipeline, vision pick, coordinator sim, regression, IK targets, unit tests). The slot-adjustment study belongs to the old layout and left t1.
- Final runs: t1 PASS except the known IK 16/18 (cap_8 and slot 8 unreachable with the cup straight down); unit tests coordinator 285, HMI 293, vision 100. t2 PASS except the known intermittent Gazebo shutdown timeout in the smoke test. Batch from empty C places 7 objects and faults at slot 8. Regression `faults` PASS. Coordinator node test 1 of 2: the first run lost a `/dual_arm/recover` reply after the restart (ROS service, not layout), the rerun PASS. Operator UI screenshots retaken.
- Found: the legacy pipeline's arm1 stopped 28 mm short when picking cap_1, the cap nearest the base (probably touching a neighbour; unconfirmed). Open: verified collision model (WP11), slot 8 (C30), occluded simulated cameras (C31, D7), axis offset 5 or 15 mm.

## Earlier result: vision upstream update to 64f28a0 (camera by-path, arm2 YUYV)

- Submodule `three-camera-vision-ros2` fast-forwarded 4a40f30 → 64f28a0; the same diff applied to `src/vision_pkg` with `git apply --ignore-whitespace --directory=dual_arm_ws/src`. sources.lock.json updated.
- Upstream only changes config: `cameras.yaml` now holds the three `/dev/v4l/by-path/` paths measured in V0 on 2026-11-11 (env USB port 4.3 AONI 310P, arm1 4.4.3 Alcor, arm2 4.4.1 Alcor), and `usb_cam.yaml` sets arm2 to `yuyv2rgb` because the Alcor camera only supports YUYV. This settles the open by-path question: the paths are tied to the physical USB ports, so cables must not be swapped.
- Upstream known issue: with all three cameras on one USB 2.0 hub the third stream fails to start (not enough bandwidth); one Alcor camera must move to another root port. Not checked here. (Superseded on 2026-11-12: the arm cameras now take turns, see the latest result.)
- PASS in WSL Jazzy: `colcon build --packages-select vision_pkg`; vision_pkg 100 tests; HMI profile tests 20. NOT_RUN: real cameras on the Orin.

## Earlier result: hardware handoff no longer needs owner authorisation

- Team members are peers: the on-site member decides after the safety checks and records the decision; there is no separate owner sign-off. Changed in HANDOFF_PROMPT_HARDWARE_TESTER (no "owner fills in" block, no H3 authorisation, D0–D8 decided on site and recorded), HARDWARE_TEST_GUIDE, AGENTS, MODIFICATION_PLAN section 5 and TEST_PLAN section 6.
- New "HOME 定位" section in HARDWARE_TEST_GUIDE: after P0 and H0 that day, the firmware `HOME` may be used at any time (e.g. both arms home to adjust cameras). Because v17 `HOME` writes only goal positions and Moving Speed is usually 0 (maximum) after power-up, the arm is first hand-guided to within 20 raw of HOME with the read-only `pose_guide.py`, then `HOME` with torque off, then `TORQUE,armN,1`. One arm at a time, hand on the e-stop.
- H3 now follows H1 instead of H2 (HOLD keeps the current position, so torque-on does not jump).
- Unchanged: engineering rules (no simulated or estimated values in calibration.yaml, no widened limits, no resend after timeout) and code gates. H4 and later stay BLOCKED because D8 and the coordinator's hardware refusal are unfinished code, not a permission matter.

## Earlier result: 2026-11-11 hardware evidence imported (H1 both arms, V0 mapping)

- Imported the text records of the Orin field tests from Azeem1010/Dual-Arm-TEST-2.0 commit `13a5b4f` into `docs/evidence/hardware/` (20261111_H1, _P0, _UPDATE, _V0, SUMMARY, tester report; the updated 20261110_H1 record). Photos, camera snapshots and large logs stay in the source repo; their hashes are kept. Three CSV names ending in a dot (invalid on Windows) were renamed by dropping the dot.
- Field status: UPDATE to `8ad9d47` PASS (coordinator 285, HMI 293, CM530 42, Mock Serial 7 stages); P0 recheck PASS; H1 NOT_RUN (in progress: Moving Speed not read, circle method skipped); V0 in progress (by-path mapping done, arm1_cam rotate 180 still correct); E0, H2 NOT_RUN; H3 and later BLOCKED.
- Facts that match the simulation: arm2 j1 is +1 like arm1; j1 facing the field is about 193 (arm1) and 519 (arm2), against simulation 192.3 and 512; both arms' j2 rises when leaning toward the user (+1). An offline FK check of the arm2 C-slot teach READs with the simulation mapping agrees with the tape-measured slot radii within about 3 mm (evidence/hardware/20261111_fk_crosscheck/). No simulation numbers were changed; these are H1 approximations, not calibration.
- Facts that do not match and go to phase C (WP11): board short side 240 mm (model 300), axes about 5 mm outside the arm-side edge (model 63 mm inside), C slots 1 and 2 nearest the arms with the odd column next to B (model: rotated 180°, columns swapped).
- Docs updated: MODIFICATION_PLAN D0, D1, D3 and WP11; COORDINATE_FRAMES; HOME_POSES (the "+Y at raw 512" question is resolved: it is `arm1_base` +Y); `runtime.json` note text only.
- Open for the owner: D6 thresholds, H3 authorisation, by-path for the two arm cameras that have no serial number (adopted upstream in 64f28a0), axis offset 5 or 15 mm (5 mm chosen 2026-11-12).

## Earlier result: operator UI screenshots in the READMEs; stale saved zones found

- New `scripts/capture_hmi_images.py` drives the real window against a simulation it starts itself, starts one transfer and presses stop. `ui_working.png` and `ui_stopped.png` are in both READMEs, with notes on what they show (simulated cameras uncalibrated in the interface calibration directory, zones for reference only, simulation slot numbering).
- Found: in the A-right simulation the environment camera cannot locate the board at start-up and falls back to `~/.ros/dual_arm_calib/sim/zones.yaml`. On this WSL machine that file was saved on 2026-11-08 with the old layout, so zones A and C were swapped on screen. It was renamed to `zones.yaml.old_layout_20261108`; the camera now reports `ZONES MISSING`. Task decisions use ground truth and were not affected. The saved file records no layout, so it is reused silently after a layout change; on hardware it must be deleted when the field changes.

## Earlier result: docs synchronised with the code; event log order fixed

- Both READMEs now describe the operator UI (how to run it, what is wired, the hardware domain). UI_PLAN matches `state.py` and `live_source.py` (wired actions, button conditions, how each outcome is judged, architecture). ROS_INTERFACES lists the two interface nodes and corrects the `hmi_sim` row and the ESP32 gap. TEST_PLAN, ORIN_DEPLOYMENT (what has actually run on the Orin), ARCHITECTURE, FUTURE_ROADMAP, AGENTS and the three handoff prompts updated; expected counts coordinator 285, HMI 293.
- Fixed while checking: the interface showed its own events (start, stop, commands) above every ROS event regardless of time, and kept them without limit. Events now carry a wall-clock stamp, are merged newest first and capped at 200. HMI unit tests 293 PASS. No Gazebo rerun; the change only affects the event list.

## Earlier result: operator UI stage 3 (task control, stop, HOME, recovery)

- New services: `/safety/trigger_stop` on `safety_supervisor` (latches with `Operator software stop` and deactivates the arm controllers; `/safety/reset` clears it) and `/dual_arm/go_home` on the coordinator (arms HOME one after the other, the B owner first, MoveIt-planned; `success` is the operator's confirmation and no token is used; refused in simulation while the journal shows an arm holding; a failed or stopped move faults the task). `/dual_arm/status` adds `at_home` per arm, null when the joint state is old.
- `hmi_sim.launch.py` now runs `safety_supervisor` with `require_estop:=false`.
- The interface sends commands from a separate node (`ros_command.py`), so `--monitor` still has no clients that command. Each command shows sent, accepted or refused, and the outcome from the status topics. Hardware modes get only the stop until stage 5. A latched simulation keeps the READY phase so the latch is shown on its own.
- Unit tests PASS: HMI 291, coordinator 285. Gazebo acceptance through the window (evidence/hmi/stage3/): one cycle SUCCEEDED; stop while moving with nothing held, then reset, HOME, recover and a second run SUCCEEDED; stop while arm 1 holds a cap, HOME refused, reset simulation to IDLE (rerun; the first attempt's third pick faulted on its own at the elbow limit, C30).
- Found: an arm stopped past a joint limit cannot be planned HOME (`CheckStartStateBounds`); simulation can only be reset. A hardware procedure is needed before H5.
- NOT_RUN: suction confirmation and torque on (stage 5), the stop in Mock and Mock Serial, hardware.

## Earlier result: tiered checks on the A-right layout, docs reviewed, axis circle-fit tool

- New `scripts/run_checks.sh t0|t1|t2 OUT_DIR` (TEST_PLAN.md section 4): t0 `check_docs.py` (Markdown links and a list of zone-order statements to review), t1 model, build, HOME, IK, reach, unit tests, collision and slot study, about 5 min, t2 Gazebo and MoveIt mock runs, vision pick and README screenshots, about 40 min. `STEPS` reruns only named steps. Each step's exit code is recorded before anything else; the earlier runners reported the exit code of `date`, which hid a FAIL (see the correction below). New `scripts/report_reach.py` (downward IK for every cap start and slot).
- README, dual_arm_ws/README.md, REQUIREMENTS, HARDWARE_TEST_GUIDE, handoff prompts, TEST_PLAN, UI_PLAN, SLOT_ADJUSTMENT reviewed against the A | B | C layout and the H1 findings. `check_docs.py` PASS: 0 broken links, every listed statement current or marked historical.
- New `fit_axis_circle` (dual_arm_coordinator, tools/axis_circle.py, 13 tests, coordinator now 272): fits the j1 axis from ruler marks of a pointer turned to several angles, with standard error, and with READ values the j1 direction and the raw count facing the field. Report only; no acceptance limits (D6), writes no calibration. Template config/hardware/axis_circle_sheet.template.yaml; method and the list of site measurements still needed in HARDWARE_TEST_GUIDE.md.
- t1 PASS except `test_ik.py` 16/18 (known). Reach unchanged: caps 4/8, slots 7/8. The slot study rerun on the new layout gives the mirror of the old results (+Y 6 mm, toward the base 18 mm, now −X).
- t2: regression `two`, image and coordinate checks, three MoveIt mock tests, vision probe and README screenshots PASS. Three FAILs fixed and rerun to PASS: the old pipeline ran in ROS domain 43 while the simulation ran in 47 (runner fixed); the vision pick test parked unreachable caps at +x, which is now zone C (park point moved to (−0.35, 0.30), missed in the layout change); the static TF of the operator tools test was left running. The smoke test FAILED only its shutdown check (Gazebo SIGINT timeout, intermittent; it passed once). README screenshots now show the new layout. Evidence: evidence/checks_20261110/.
- Correction to the layout stage (evidence/a_right_layout_20261110/README.md, already corrected there): the "slot proposals and slot self-collision PASS" in its logs was not valid. Those checks read old-layout joint solutions, and `verify_slot_proposals.py` had actually raised; the wrong exit code hid it. Both PASS after the slot study rerun in t1.
- NOT_RUN: regression `faults` and `batch`, 3 consecutive vision picks, CM-530 tests, all hardware. Board width and base-to-edge distance still CAD values.

## Earlier result: simulation layout follows the measured zone side (A on the arm's right)

- The user decided D0 from the 2026-11-10 H1 measurement. The model is now the source CAD assembly, arms and platforms, turned 180 degrees about world Z: arm1 at (-0.10, +0.08725), arm2 at (+0.10, +0.08725), both facing -Y, zone A at -X, so the user sees A | B | C. This replaces the mirrored layout of commit `c7dfba3`. Every field coordinate only changed the sign of x; slot numbering is kept (slot 1 nearest the user, still unchecked on site). j1 direction is +1 for both arms (arm1 measured, arm2 assumed), raw_at_cad_zero unchanged, so home_A and home_C TCPs are x mirrors of the old ones.
- `truth.py` no longer assumes zone A is at +X. Simulated env vision sets `field.reverse: true` in `vision_sim` and `hmi_sim`; the hardware `env_vision.yaml` keeps `false` until V0.
- PASS in WSL Jazzy: CAD pose (264 components), build, HOME poses and collision, coordinator 259, HMI 262, vision_pkg 99, MotionGateway, operator tools and safety supervisor against the MoveIt mock, old pipeline two objects, coordinator demo one cycle. `test_ik.py` stays 16/18, the same two points as before, mirrored. The first pipeline run FAILED on a `x > -0.10` "cleared B" check missed in the mirror; fixed and rerun. The sim smoke test FAILED both runs only on its shutdown check (Gazebo did not exit within 5 s of SIGINT), a message also seen in older logs. Evidence: evidence/a_right_layout_20261110/; previous files in evidence/before_a_right_layout_20261110/.
- Not changed: board width (CAD 300 mm, measured about 235 mm) and base-to-edge distance (CAD 63 mm inside, measured about 10 mm outside). NOT_RUN: vision-driven pick, slot adjustment study, README screenshots. Hardware NOT_RUN.

## Latest result: first Orin hardware session imported (SETUP, P0, H0 PASS; H1 partial)

- The on-site session of 2026-11-10 (code at `3fd258c`) is recorded in [Azeem1010/Dual-Arm-TEST-2.0](https://github.com/Azeem1010/Dual-Arm-TEST-2.0) `fc4cd41`. Its text records, outputs and photo hashes are copied to evidence/hardware/ with a reading in evidence/hardware/README.md; photos and large logs stay in that repo.
- On the Orin: install first FAIL (ROS source Signed-By conflict, then missing noble-updates), build first FAIL (SWSCALE), then PASS; coordinator 259, HMI 262, CM530 42, Mock Serial 7 phases, mock start and stop. P0 PASS with the e-stop checked by spoken report only. H0 PASS: board path, `VERSION,5`, HOME values as expected, all 8 positions change when pushed.
- H1, arm1 only: turning j1 toward the arm's own right decreases raw (direction +1) and points at zone A, so the user sees A | B | C. This is the opposite of the simulated far-side layout (commit `c7dfba3`, A on the arm's left, j1 −1) and agrees with the CAD orientation before that commit. Straight-up READ 200,505,498,513 roughly supports raw 512 = vertical. The j2 "lifts, raw decreases" note started near vertical, so its direction is not settled. Axes are about 10 mm outside the board edge (model: 63 mm inside) on the A/B and B/C lines; the board's short side works out to about 235 mm, not 300.
- Applied the session's `install_jazzy.sh` change (reuse an existing ROS 2 Noble source; add five FFmpeg dev packages) and documented the three install failures in ORIN_DEPLOYMENT.md, including that the FFmpeg 6.1 dev packages overwrite files of NVIDIA's ffmpeg 8.0.1 (effect NOT_RUN). `bash -n` PASS; the script was not rerun here.
- Updated COORDINATE_FRAMES.md, FUTURE_ROADMAP.md 3.1 and 3.2, MODIFICATION_PLAN.md D0/D1 and HOME_POSES.md with the measurements. **The model, runtime.json, vision configs and tests are unchanged**; changing the layout waits for the user's D0 decision.
- NOT_RUN: arm2 H1, Moving Speed of 8 motors, motor 15 cable check, arm1 READ facing the field and at home_A, direct board measurement, V0, E0, H2. BLOCKED: H2 acceptance and H3 (owner fields empty), H4–H8 (D8). arm1 torque was left off on site.

## Latest result: motor table shows AX-12A counts from the firmware

- `cm530_hardware` exports two more state interfaces per joint, `raw_position` (Present Position exactly as the last successful v17 `READ` returned it) and `raw_target` (the last `AX` the firmware answered `OK,AX` to; NaN until one is acknowledged, so always NaN when read-only). They appear on `/dynamic_joint_states`; no command to the board was added. Only the hardware branch of `dual_arm_cad.urdf.xacro` declares them (generator updated too), so simulation and mock have none.
- Operator UI motor table: joint, motor ID, actual °, target °, difference °, actual count, target count, margin to limit °. The limit bar and the rad column were removed; rad and estimated velocity moved to the joint name tooltip. Counts are never derived from angles: in simulation the count columns stay empty. Counts expire after 1 s, a target or actual count outside the driver calibration's `min_raw..max_raw` is shown red, and a difference above 2° yellow.
- PASS in WSL Jazzy: cm530_hardware 42 tests (3 new scheduler tests), dual_arm_hmi 262 tests, xacro gives 8 `raw_position` for hardware and 0 for sim and mock. `scripts/test_cm530_mock.py` all 7 phases PASS with new count checks: read-only gives `raw_position` 512 on all 8 joints and NaN `raw_target`; after moving arm1 to TARGET, `raw_target` = `raw_position` = [551, 483, 532, 561] and arm2 `raw_target` stays 512 (the AX acknowledged at activation). Evidence: evidence/cm530_mock_integration.json.
- NOT_RUN: real CM-530 and motors, Orin.

## Latest result: vision upstream update to 4a40f30 (frame names)

- Submodule `three-camera-vision-ros2` fast-forwarded b98fb4e → 4a40f30; the same diff applied to `src/vision_pkg` and `src/vision_interfaces` with `git apply --ignore-whitespace --directory=dual_arm_ws/src`, keeping the local `publish_debug_image` additions. sources.lock.json updated.
- Upstream only relabels `header.frame_id` (`armN_base` → `armN_base_link`, cameras → `*_camera_optical_frame`); coordinate math is unchanged, so `coordinator.yaml` keeps `vision_base_frame: armN_base`. ROS_INTERFACES.md gap 3 resolved, gap 4 reworded.
- Fixed test_launch.py stubs, which lacked the `publish_debug_image` argument added by the operator UI (7 failures before this update too).
- PASS in WSL Jazzy: `colcon build --packages-select vision_interfaces vision_pkg`; vision_pkg 99, coordinator 259, vision adapter 10. Gazebo pipeline not rerun.

## Latest result: operator UI stage 2 (start and stop)

- The interface now starts, stops and resets the system in its own process group, records the session so a restarted interface adopts it, and removes Gazebo servers and tagged processes left behind. Only one managing interface may run; `--monitor` opens a watch-only one. Settings are in `config/profiles.yaml`; hardware modes refuse to start without a port, and motion without measured controller tolerances. Added `scripts/hmi_windows.bat` and `scripts/install_hmi_shortcut.sh`.
- PASS: 242 offline tests with real processes. Ten simulation start and stop cycles through the interface buttons: ready in 29.8 to 36.6 s, stopped in 3.7 to 10.3 s, nothing left behind. The interface killed while the system was ready, and a new one adopted and stopped it. The raw verdict counted the interface's own node as a leftover; the correction is in evidence/hmi/stage2/05_assessment.json.
- Remaining: stop and task buttons are still disconnected (stage 3). Hardware and Mock Serial starts were not run through the interface. NOT_RUN: Orin, double-clicking the shortcuts.

## Latest result: operator UI stage 1 (read-only monitor)

- `dual_arm_hmi` now shows live ROS data: three cameras with the vision nodes' own annotations, four Gazebo views, eight joints with limits, task progress, the zone B interlock and calibration results. Vision nodes gained an optional `publish_debug_image` (off by default), and `hmi_sim.launch.py` starts everything the interface shows. Two OpenCV overlay texts that printed Chinese as question marks now use ASCII.
- PASS: 205 offline tests. Live against the simulation, off screen with the real widgets: a full transfer to SUCCEEDED, a lost system announced, and `ros2 node info` shows no command interface. Simulation speed is 0.182 without and 0.183 with the interface. Evidence: evidence/hmi/stage1/.
- Remaining: every button including the stop button is deliberately disconnected and labelled so. Camera rate in WSL is about 2 FPS because of rendering, so the 10 FPS target is unverified. In simulation the task decides zones from ground truth, so the interlock shows only ownership and fault as authoritative. NOT_RUN: Orin, hardware, stage 2 onward.

## Latest result: operator UI stage 0

- New package `dual_arm_hmi`: the full PyQt5 interface driven by invented data in twelve scenarios. The state and button rules are pure Python. Plan and user decisions are in UI_PLAN.md. `install_jazzy.sh` now installs `python3-pyqt5` and `fonts-noto-cjk`.
- The zone B interlock is drawn from the same rules as `ZoneManager` and the arm workflows.
- PASS: 166 tests, including every scenario at four resolutions off screen. Real window on WSLg opened and a real F12 press sent the stop action. Evidence: evidence/hmi/stage0/.
- Remaining: user visual review and one run on the Orin. WSL has no system CJK font yet, so the checks used a private font folder. There is no ROS data source, so no button reaches ROS. NOT_RUN: 150% display scaling, Orin, everything from stage 1 on.

## Latest result: C32 safety latch enforced

- `safety_supervisor` now checks the arm controllers every 0.2 s while latched and stops any that are active. `controllers_stopped` in `/safety/status` is now the verified result: it is false while a controller is active or cannot be checked. A reset is excluded from this check while it runs, and a failed reset stops the controllers again.
- PASS: coordinator 259 tests (6 new, over real ROS services against a stand-in controller manager; 5 of 5 repeat runs). MoveIt mock 29 checks; manual activation stopped in about 0.29 s. Mock serial: controllers inactive again after a manual switch. The correct startup order still works, and the wrong order is still refused. Evidence: evidence/c32/.
- Remaining: a window of about 0.3 s before the controllers are stopped again, so manual switching stays forbidden. NOT_RUN: hardware and Gazebo physics.

## Latest result: README images, hardware guide, safety finding

- README images recaptured from a two-object run of `demo_pick_place.launch.py cycles:=2` (SUCCEEDED, completed 2, no leftover processes) with new `scripts/capture_readme_images.py`. They replace the old-layout images noted as stale below. The first capture attempt missed short states and was discarded before publishing. Evidence: evidence/readme_images/.
- New HARDWARE_TEST_GUIDE.md walks through every stage in order, and HANDOFF_PROMPT_NEXT_COMPUTER.md is for continuing on another machine. Every hardware step in the guide is NOT_RUN.
- FAIL found on mock serial (evidence/safety_order/): the documented order, `/safety/reset` before activating the hardware, is refused with "Controller activation was refused". Activating the hardware first and then resetting works; ORIN_DEPLOYMENT.md and the README are corrected.
- FAIL, not fixed (conflict C32): while the supervisor is latched and has stopped the controllers, a manual `switch_controllers --activate` activates them, and `/safety/status` still reports `controllers_stopped: true`. The guide forbids that command until the supervisor is fixed.
- New decision D8: the source of the `/safety/estop` heartbeat. H4 and later stay BLOCKED until it is decided.

## Latest result: documentation audit

- All project documents were compared with the code and corrected: both READMEs, AGENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE, COORDINATE_FRAMES, HOME_POSES, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN, PIPELINE_DEMO, SLOT_ADJUSTMENT, SOURCE_AUDIT, VISION_CALIBRATION, VISION_INTEGRATION, FUTURE_ROADMAP, MODIFICATION_PLAN, HANDOFF_PROMPT, ROS_INTERFACES and RESUME. REQUIREMENTS.md and historical evidence were not changed.
- PASS: `demo_pick_place.launch.py` with `operator_console start` ended SUCCEEDED for its default one cycle, its first full run. The old `run_pipeline.sh --count 2` also passed at the current 1.0/0.5/1.0 speeds. Coordinator pytest 253 passed. Links: 24 documents, none broken. Evidence: evidence/docs_audit/.
- FAIL, then corrected: the README unit test command gave 3 import errors, because it replaced PYTHONPATH and lost rclpy. With the ROS entries kept, all 253 tests pass. The README now uses the pytest command.
- Still stale, needs a new capture: the README screenshots show the old layout and the old simultaneous pipeline; they are labelled as such. NOT_RUN: hardware.

## Latest result: WP12 ESP32 suction backend

- New `Esp32Suction` in gateways/gripper.py, using /suction_command and /suction_status from ray000518/micro-ros commit 0c28c7f. It publishes the command, requires a matching echo, waits for vacuum on grasp, then asks the operator to confirm, because the firmware has no vacuum sensor. The hardware template now selects this backend and leaves module mapping and timings null. A fault never sends the all-off command, which would drop a held object.
- PASS: coordinator 253 tests, including two across real ROS topics against a stand-in that behaves like the firmware. Evidence: evidence/wp12/. ORIN_DEPLOYMENT.md section 6.1 covers the agent build, start order and first power-on checks.
- NOT_RUN: a real ESP32, actual suction and the micro-ROS agent. Module mapping, relay polarity and vacuum time need checking on the rig. Gazebo regression was not rerun; the Gazebo backend did not change.

## Latest result: WP13 documentation

- New TEST_PLAN.md and ORIN_DEPLOYMENT.md. ROS_INTERFACES.md now covers the coordinator and safety supervisor, from a capture on the MoveIt mock (evidence/wp13/04_node_info.txt), and its known gaps are current. HANDOFF_PROMPT.md state is current.
- NOT_RUN: every deployment step in ORIN_DEPLOYMENT.md has been written from the code and has not been executed on an Orin or real arms.
- All work that needs no hardware or user decision is done. Remaining: WP7 (D7), WP11 (D0, D3), WP12 (D5), READ retry (D2), and hardware stages H0 to H8.

## Latest result: WP10 operator tools

- New in dual_arm_coordinator/tools: `cm530_probe` (allow-listed read-only commands, exclusive port, no retry), `check_calibration_sheet` (offline; reports candidates, writes nothing, limits have no defaults), `manual_xy` (plans only unless `--execute`, refuses while a task runs) and `operator_console` (one-shot commands; confirm and recover need explicit flags).
- PASS: coordinator 233 unit tests; 18 integration checks on mock serial and MoveIt mock, including an independent check that planning leaves the joints still. Evidence: evidence/wp10/.
- NOT_RUN: real board, and `check_calibration_sheet` on real measurements. `manual_xy` is a command-line tool, so the ManualXY service defined in WP1 currently has no server. A hardware `arm1_base` transform still does not exist.

## Latest result: WP9 safety supervisor

- New safety_monitor.py and safety_supervisor.py. On an asserted emergency stop, a missing or stale heartbeat, or a coordinator that stops reporting, the arm controllers are deactivated and the state latches until `/safety/reset` succeeds with healthy inputs. hardware.launch.py starts it whenever motion is enabled on a real port.
- PASS on MoveIt mock: 26 checks over heartbeat loss, killed coordinator and asserted emergency stop; motion is refused while latched and reset is refused until inputs recover. Coordinator unit tests: 201. Evidence: evidence/wp9/.
- Conflict C29 measured: the arm stopped about 1.2 s after the coordinator was killed, against about 22 s before. Heartbeat loss stopped it in about 2.7 s, which includes the 2 s age limit; an asserted stop took about 0.3 s.
- The first run failed because the test reset before the restarted coordinator had reported in, and reset was correctly refused; kept as run1_reset_before_coordinator_ready/.
- NOT_RUN: Gazebo physics, hardware. This is a software interlock and does not replace a physical emergency stop; no hardware heartbeat source exists yet.

## Latest result: WP8 driver hardening

- cm530_hardware: the handshake first sends 96 DEL characters to clear a partial line left in the firmware, which unlike a line ending cannot execute it. Activation is refused before any torque if a joint rests outside its limits. `on_error` stops the scheduler and sends one HOLD per arm only while the link is synchronized. New all-null controllers_hardware.template.yaml, which hardware.launch.py refuses.
- PASS: 35 gtests (29 before), seven-phase mock serial, ASan/UBSan and TSan with 20 repetitions and no reports. Evidence: evidence/wp8/.
- Not done: READ retry waits for decision D2. c-review NOT_RUN because its Workflow tool is unavailable here. Whether the DEL flush cures the real `ERR,BAD_CMD` is NOT_RUN, since that cause is a hypothesis. No hardware was used.

## Latest result: WP7 vision gateway (partial, BLOCKED)

- New gateways/vision.py: vision services behind calibration status, a new-image-after-settling check, finite and frame checks, and TF conversion to the world frame. Simulated homographies and validity records are generated from the known Gazebo camera geometry and the measured error.
- PASS: with no calibration record the run stops before touching any object; with a record, arm1 takes its pick target from vision and two objects reach slots 3 and 4. Measured arm1 detection error 0.94 mm or less against a 1 mm budget. Coordinator unit tests: 186. Evidence: evidence/wp7/.
- Reliability: 1 of 5 runs passed first (before_timing_fixes/), with three causes: a calibration age limit in wall time against a publisher on simulated time, an arrival timeout too short for 0.2x real time, and an arrival tolerance equal to the plugin contact limit. After tightening the tolerance to 0.5 mm and lengthening the wall-clock timeouts, 3 of 3 passed. Three runs is a small sample.
- BLOCKED (decision D7, conflict C31): zone and slot state still come from ground truth, because the fixed overhead simulated cameras are occluded by the arms at HOME.
- Rerun with final parameters: two objects and all 21 fault checks PASS. The time reduction is now 48.6%, below the 50% target (WP6S). NOT_RUN: hardware, hardware frame_id fix (C20).

## Latest result: WP6S faster simulation speeds

- Simulation scales changed from transport/contact/acceleration 0.5/0.25/0.25 to 1.0/0.5/1.0 in runtime.json and config/sim/coordinator.yaml. No joint limit, model or hardware setting changed.
- PASS: two-object regression at the new speeds. Trajectory span fell from 727.6 s to 351.8 s (-51.6%), and the whole run from about 12.4 min to 6.0 min. Evidence: evidence/wp6s/.
- Limits: transport is now at the URDF velocity limit of 0.5 rad/s, and Gazebo ran at about 0.2 times real time at idle, so further gains need higher limits (user approval) or a lighter simulation.
- NOT_RUN at the new speeds: fault scenarios, the old pipeline, hardware. These scales must not be used on hardware.

## Latest result: WP6 simulation regression

- PASS through the coordinator node in Gazebo: two objects into slots 3 and 4 (record, ground truth and planning scene agree), and fault scenarios: failed release, emergency-stop heartbeat loss, latched emergency stop, cancel while holding. Coordinator unit tests: 170. Evidence: evidence/wp6/.
- FAIL, recorded as results: eight objects from an empty C stops at slot 1 before any object moves; six objects placed 4 and then found no reachable cap. Only cap_3 to cap_6 are inside arm1 downward IK (conflict C30), so the current layout cannot transfer eight objects.
- Two gaps found and fixed while preparing this work: recovery now clears leftover planning scene objects, and the next slot is checked before an object is taken from A so none is stranded in B.
- The first fault run failed because the test called start before the first heartbeat arrived, and start was correctly refused; kept as faults_run1_start_before_heartbeat/.
- NOT_RUN: vision-driven transfer, hardware. The old pipeline was not retired.

## Latest result: WP5 coordinator node

- New coordinator_node.py with /dual_arm/start, cancel, confirm, recover, status, /handoff/b_state and /dual_arm/permit, plus gateways/truth.py and demo_pick_place.launch.py. Hardware mode refuses to start until the vision gateway and safety supervisor exist.
- PASS in Gazebo with ground truth: cancel stops a moving arm and ends in FAULT, wrong and off-HOME recovery are refused, FAULT and interrupted runs survive a restart, and one full A->B->C finished with the real suction plugin (cap in slot 3 by ground truth, slots 1 and 2 prefilled per C25). Coordinator unit tests: 165. Evidence: evidence/wp5/.
- Two earlier Gazebo runs failed because of test timing, both kept: run 1 canceled while MoveIt was still planning; run 2 commanded the arm while the killed run's trajectory was still executing.
- New conflict C29, measured here: after the coordinator is killed the sent trajectory keeps running (about 22 s, 0.26 rad). WP9 must close this before any hardware motion.
- NOT_RUN: `demo_pick_place.launch.py` beyond argument parsing, eight objects, vision-driven transfer, hardware.

## Latest result: WP4 suction gateway

- New gateways/gripper.py with Gazebo and manual-token backends behind one `suction(arm, operation)` call, plus a factory that refuses auto-confirm and the Gazebo backend on hardware. The ESP32 backend stays BLOCKED until a protocol exists.
- Commands follow the plugin parser in dual_arm_gripper/policy.hpp. Every command has a timeout because the plugin drops bad commands silently, and it waits for topic discovery before publishing.
- PASS: coordinator 142 tests, including 41 new for protocol format, sequences, fault replies, timeouts, late or stale tokens, cancel and factory refusals. Two of them cross real ROS topics against a stand-in node. Evidence: evidence/wp4/.
- NOT_RUN: the real Gazebo suction plugin (WP6) and any physical suction. New conflict C28: the 1 mm plugin contact limit versus the 1.09 mm recorded simulated vision error.

## Latest result: WP3 motion gateway

- New gateways/motion.py, motion_math.py and homes.py. Non-contact moves use MoveGroup joint goals solved by CadKinematics; contact moves follow a sampled vertical line with every waypoint collision-checked. Arrival needs consecutive new joint states within the TCP limit. HOME comes from runtime.json or a measured calibration, never the SRDF.
- PASS on MoveIt mock: full A->B->C path, planning scene attach/detach, removing an absent B object, refusal of unreachable and colliding targets, refused descent leaves the arm still, cancel stops the motion. Coordinator unit tests: 101. Evidence: evidence/wp3/.
- The first mock run reported PASS for a collision check that was actually refused by IK. The test was corrected to require a collision reason and rerun; the first run is kept as 04a/05a.
- NOT_RUN: Gazebo physics and hardware. Mock joints follow commands exactly, so the micrometre errors say nothing about positioning accuracy.

## Latest result: WP2 ROS-free task logic

- New in dual_arm_coordinator: workflow/ (arm1, arm2, batch transfer, IO contract), journal.py (atomic record, file lock, configuration fingerprint) and confirmation.py (one-time expiring tokens). ZoneManager and SlotManager gained restore support.
- Each state, tool status and B owner is written to disk before the action that depends on it. A fault keeps B ownership and marks the tool unknown; recovery needs a token, both arms at HOME, B empty and a contiguous C observation.
- PASS: coordinator 81 tests with a fake IO world (cancel after every motion, suction failures, invalid vision, B conflicts, C mismatch, restart, fingerprint change, tokens, recovery); installed modules do not load rclpy. The first run had 2 failures from inconsistent exception types, fixed in code; log kept as evidence/wp2/02a_first_run_2_failed.log.
- NOT_RUN: nothing here has run against ROS, MoveIt, Gazebo or hardware. Full build and pipeline were not rerun because only the coordinator package changed and the old pipeline does not use these modules.
- New conflicts C25-C27 are in MODIFICATION_PLAN.md: slot 1 versus sequential filling, environment camera occlusion versus the C count check, and removing an absent B scene object.

## Latest result: WP1 interfaces and coordinator skeleton

- New package dual_arm_interfaces (ConfirmStep, ManualXY). dual_arm_coordinator now declares its dependencies and has a strict task configuration loader with a `check_task_config` command.
- config/sim/coordinator.yaml holds values taken from the existing pipeline and world generator. config/hardware/coordinator.yaml is an all-null template that the loader refuses.
- PASS: build of 12 packages, coordinator 27 tests (8 existing, 19 new), interface show, installed sim config accepted, hardware template refused, two-object pipeline regression (74 events). Evidence: evidence/wp1/.
- Not done: no coordinator node yet (WP5). The pipeline places into slots 3 and 4, so its PASS says nothing about slot 1.

## Latest result: WP0 baseline before the roadmap work

- Plan is now [MODIFICATION_PLAN.md](MODIFICATION_PLAN.md); handoff text is [HANDOFF_PROMPT.md](HANDOFF_PROMPT.md). No code, model or calibration changed.
- PASS at commit c7dfba3: build, coordinator 8, vision adapter 10, vision_pkg 99, cm530_hardware 29 gtests, gripper 1, five-phase mock serial, two-object Gazebo ground-truth pipeline (74 events). Evidence: evidence/roadmap_baseline/.
- Correction: the "33 unit tests" below counts 29 gtests plus 4 CTest wrappers.
- BLOCKED: zone A side and j1 direction have conflicting evidence, and j2 direction/zero is contradictory. See FUTURE_ROADMAP.md section 3. This also puts the far-side layout below in question for hardware.
- Gazebo shutdown was not retested by the original method. A process-group SIGINT exited in about 1 s with no leftovers, which does not clear the earlier FAIL.

## Latest result: far-side simulation layout (supersedes the BLOCKED note and C reach row below)

- Simulation now follows the user-stated layout: arm bases on the side far from the user, facing -Y, zone A on the arm's left. Source CAD is unchanged; the generators apply the layout. Layout itself is NOT_RUN against hardware (no photo or measurement).
- PASS: CAD pose transform (264 visuals), HOME FK/limits, HOME self/inter-arm collision, 8 coordinator tests, simulation static TF, three cameras and four views, both_arms execution, two-object A->B->C regression with Gazebo ground truth (74 events).
- FAIL: slot 1 is out of reach by downward IK at its current position, and it is the first slot in the fill order. IK is still 16/18, the same two mirrored targets as before. A +Y 10 mm move passes IK and box self-collision with 5.06 deg margin, but nothing is applied. See SLOT_ADJUSTMENT.md.
- j1 simulation direction changed to -1 by inference. Motor direction, Arm 1 j1 zero, base-to-edge distances, arm2 axis convention, hardware TF and the vision target adapter remain NOT_RUN. Eight-object and vision-driven transfer remain NOT_RUN. README screenshots in docs/images still show the old layout.

## Latest result: coordinate axis definitions

- New [COORDINATE_FRAMES.md](COORDINATE_FRAMES.md) records the OpenCV-side X/Y definitions. User stated the physical arm bases are on the side far from the user, with zone A on the left when facing the field from the base.
- The loaded CAD model puts zone A on the arm's right, so model and hardware are mirrored. Vision-to-URDF conversion is BLOCKED until that is resolved. Base-to-edge measurements and the `calibrate_caps` input method are NOT_RUN. Documentation only; no code or test changed.

## Latest result: ROS interface specification

- New [ROS_INTERFACES.md](ROS_INTERFACES.md) lists actual topics, services and actions, checked against a live headless vision_sim graph (evidence/ros_graph_vision_sim). mock, hardware and vision.launch.py graphs remain NOT_RUN; `/vision/calibration_status` content NOT_RUN.
- The task layer is not wired: no coordinator node, no client of any `/vision/*` service. Other gaps, including the hardware camera frame_id mismatch, are listed in that file. No code changed.

## Latest result: cm530_hardware on mock serial (supersedes the Hardware row below)

- New package src/cm530_hardware: protocol-5 parser, single-owner link, background scheduler, strict calibration and CM530SystemInterface plugin. New hardware.launch.py and URDF mode:=hardware.
- Tested against the unmodified v17 bridge.c, ax12.c and dynamixel.c with only the AX-12 bus simulated, including over a pseudo-terminal. 33 unit tests PASS; ASan/UBSan and TSan 20 repetitions PASS; five-phase launch integration PASS. Real UART timing, motors and the Orin remain NOT_RUN.
- Read-only by default. Motion is refused without measured calibration, verified Moving Speed, max_step_raw and a controllers_file with measured goal tolerances. Hardware starts inactive even then.
- Next hardware steps: fill calibration.yaml from real measurements (Arm 1 j1 still BLOCKED), measure the achievable loop rate, then a supervised first motion with an independent emergency stop. c-review was not run because its Workflow tool is unavailable here.

## Latest result: raw-512 zero mapping (supersedes the HOME and regression bullets below)

- User stated the physical zero is all four motors at raw 512 with the arm straight. Read as vertical, CAD q=(0,-35,-55,0) deg, so runtime.json raw_at_cad_zero j2..j4 = 631.35/699.55/512. Directions are inferred. Mapping stays simulation_assumed; hardware_use_allowed=false.
- Arm 1 j1 is UNRESOLVED: raw 90 is 123.75 deg from raw 512, yet the user reports home_A faces zone A and raw 512 faces +Y. raw_at_cad_zero 192.3 is a simulation placeholder (-30 deg). Needs motor 17 readings; see HOME_POSES.md.
- Wrist upper limit widened from 1.5 to 1.65 rad in simulation only, with user approval, so raw 825 fits. Physical clearance NOT_RUN.
- Build PASS, 8 coordinator tests PASS, HOME FK/limits PASS, HOME self/inter-arm collision PASS (home_collision.json; arm model only, world and path NOT_RUN).
- Two-object A->B->C regression PASS with revised geometry and this HOME (transfer_pipeline.json, zero512_pipeline.log): Gazebo ground truth, headless. Full eight-object, vision-driven, and PlanningScene acceptance remain NOT_RUN.
- Gazebo shutdown still FAIL: launch did not exit within 45 s of SIGINT and Gazebo needed SIGTERM.

## Current revision (supersedes historical rows below)

- User approved correcting the reversed camera support and filling C slots flush. Ten terminal components corrected, axes/TCP unchanged, 264 visuals retained, eight 25 mm pads top z=14 mm. Geometry checks PASS.
- Corrected STEP and standalone SolidWorks 2019 multi-body SLDPRT exported; SLDPRT reopened with 342 solid bodies and no warnings. Original newer-version native feature-tree assembly cannot be edited by installed SolidWorks 2019. Intermediate imported SLDASM and PackAndGo directory have unresolved portability concerns; do not deliver them alone.
- User approved simulation-assumed HOME conversion. Firmware counts preserved; simulated home_A/home_C map to base −/+30°, shoulder −10°, elbow 40°, wrist 60°. Named states built. Hardware calibration NOT_RUN, hardware use forbidden.
- Runtime scales now transport .50 / contact .25 / acceleration .25. Windows/WSL and Orin README and launch wrappers provided; Orin actual build/runtime NOT_RUN.
- Historical three-object overlapping pickup/transfer demonstration completed PASS before these geometry/HOME changes. New two-object regression is in progress; startup delay traced to ament package lookup on Windows-mounted storage. No claim of revised transfer acceptance yet.

See RESUME.md and latest evidence for ongoing results.

The complete requirements are **not yet met**. Hardware remains disabled. This ledger distinguishes recorded component evidence from end-to-end acceptance.

User decision: preserve original CAD and measure/propose the smallest platform/slot adjustment. See [SLOT_ADJUSTMENT.md](SLOT_ADJUSTMENT.md). No candidate has been applied to runtime geometry.

| Work | Current evidence and limitation |
|---|---|
| Source integration | Four requested repositories pinned in sources.lock.json; integration copies under src. |
| CAD | 264 exported components; source-pose transform check recorded PASS. Axis assignments, real joint zeros, mass/inertia and limits need physical validation. |
| ROS / MoveIt | Packages built in WSL Ubuntu 24.04 / Jazzy. Recorded mock planning and shutdown PASS. |
| Gazebo | Recorded both_arms small joint Plan & Execute and feedback PASS, three camera streams and four rendered views PASS. Overall runtime FAIL because Gazebo does not terminate cleanly. This is not a pick/place test. |
| Vision | Recorded upstream suite: 99 passed. Saved Gazebo image detection sees 8 caps in arm1 and 8 holes in arm2; environment sees 4 caps due occlusion. Live service freshness and calibrated TF authorization are not completed. |
| Calibration | Recorded 10 validity/plane-validation tests passed. Static-scene held-out homography errors measured, but all operational and hardware calibration validity remains NOT_RUN. |
| Suction | Recorded isolated Gazebo fixed-joint attachment/release physics test PASS, policy ASan/UBSan test PASS. Runtime coordinator and PlanningScene attachment synchronization not completed. |
| C reach | Original layout fails downward approach checks. −Y 7 mm and 10 mm candidates each rechecked at 248 points: discrete IK/FK PASS, but MoveIt conservative-box self-collision FAIL (49/248 and 62/248). Six selected CAD surface witnesses show no crossings; not sufficient to clear collision rejection. No world-collision or hardware acceptance. |
| A→B→C | NOT_RUN. Coordinator has preliminary zone/slot helpers and CAD IK; no complete runtime sequence. |
| Hardware | Protocol source audited. Single-port ros2_control backend, ESP32 integration and Orin deployment acceptance not completed. |

Next engineering work:

1. Resolve Gazebo shutdown failure without suppressing the failure result.
2. Validate a more accurate arm collision model against source CAD, resolve link_2/link_4 box rejection, then add a complete collision scene and validate approach/withdrawal for original reachable targets and separately named proposed layouts.
3. Acquire independent calibration observations; integrate image acquisition timestamps, TF provenance and freshness gates. Current homographies are measurements, not motion authorization.
4. Implement runtime gripper/PlanningScene synchronization, B-zone ownership and verified eight-slot coordinator. Original geometry cannot meet all-eight-slot reach acceptance as currently modelled.
5. Complete the single CM530 backend and failure tests from actual v17 protocol, ESP32 interface and Orin deployment instructions.

Recorded artifacts are under docs/evidence. Re-run affected checks after changing model, launch, world or calibration. Raw logs may describe earlier intermediate states; the JSON filenames cited here hold the latest recorded result of their respective scripts.
