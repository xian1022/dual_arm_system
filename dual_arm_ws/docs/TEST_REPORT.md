## 2026-11-12 Slot 8 with a tilted cup; system audit

Where straight down has no solution, the cup may tilt up to `motion.max_tool_tilt_deg` (simulation 9°), choosing the solution nearest the current joints; tilted contact targets are raised for the cup or held cap rim. Simulated cap_8 starts at (-0.24, 0.05). Details and every attempt: evidence/tilt_slot8_20261112/README.md.

| Check | Result | Evidence / scope |
|---|---|---|
| t1 generation, `test_cad_pose`, build, IK, reach | PASS | IK 18/18; slot 8 needs about 5° (final2_t1/) |
| Unit tests coordinator / HMI / vision; gripper gtest | PASS | 293 / 293 / 100; plugin accepts up to 10° and 2 mm vertical |
| Regression `batch` (8 objects from empty C) | PASS | all 8 slots filled, run ends `FULL` (final2_sim/) |
| Regression `faults`, `two`; motion gateway; operator tools | PASS | final_sim/, final_t2/ |
| Vision calibration, probe, vision pick | PASS | arm1 error 0.70 mm (final2_t2/); with cap_8 at (-0.205, 0.015) it was 2.21 mm, hidden by the arm |
| Earlier attempts | FAIL | smallest tilt hit the base in MoveIt; rim contact 1.00 mm short; held cap 2.63 / 1.36 mm short; a cap picked tilted shifted ~1 mm at B; one run invalid because a stale coordinator answered |
| Live ROS graph on `hmi_sim` with the operator UI nodes | PASS after review | no type, QoS or missing-server problem; 10 subscriptions without publisher are optional by design (scripts/audit_expect_sim.json); evidence/system_audit_20261112/ |

## 2026-11-12 Phase C: measured field geometry and slot numbering

Board 600 × 240 mm, j1 axes at world (±0.10, 0.125), C slots numbered as on the real board, caps at the mirrored slots, B at (0, 0), arm cameras at x ±0.15. Final runs on the finished code; earlier partial runs and their fixes are listed in evidence/phase_c_20261111/README.md.

| Check | Result | Evidence / scope |
|---|---|---|
| t1: model and world generation, `test_cad_pose`, build, HOME, reach, HOME collision | PASS | evidence/phase_c_20261111/t1_final/ |
| t1: `test_ik.py` | FAIL | 16/18; cap_8 (-0.17, -0.055) and slot 8 (0.17, -0.055) have no downward-suction solution. The real arm reached slot 8 with the cup tilted about 9° |
| t1: unit tests coordinator / HMI / vision | PASS | 285 / 293 / 100 |
| t2: smoke test | FAIL | only `shutdown`: Gazebo did not stop within 5 s of SIGINT (known, intermittent; it passed in t2_camera/). Cameras, four views, controllers, MoveIt plan PASS |
| t2: simulated images, coordinate validation | PASS | t2_final/ |
| t2: regression `two` from an empty C area | PASS | caps in slots 1 and 2 |
| t2: legacy pipeline two objects | PASS | now reads the layout from coordinator.yaml and picks nearest arm1 HOME first (cap_4, cap_6) |
| t2: motion gateway, operator tools, safety supervisor (mock) | PASS | unreachable-target check now uses slot 8 |
| t2: vision pick | PASS | arm1 calibration error 0.70 mm (budget 1 mm); was 1.15 mm with the camera at x -0.20 |
| t2: README screenshots | PASS | docs/images/ retaken |
| Regression `batch` (8 objects from empty C) | FAIL | 7 placed in slots 1–7; FAULT at slot 8 (unreachable). The test expects this and reports PASS. evidence/phase_c_20261111/batch/ |
| Regression `faults` (B place point moved to (0, 0)) | PASS | 21 checks; evidence/phase_c_20261111/extra/ |
| Coordinator node in Gazebo (`test_coordinator_sim.py`) | FAIL, then PASS | first run: `/dual_arm/recover` reply lost after the coordinator restart (`failed to send response (timeout)` in its log), unrelated to the layout; rerun on a fresh simulation PASS, 22 checks including a full cycle into slot 1 (extra_rerun/). 1 of 2 passed |
| Zone and slot state by vision | BLOCKED | arm cameras at HOME: arm1 sees 3 caps, arm2 finds 0 slots (C31, D7 unchanged); tasks keep using ground truth for zones and slots |

## 2026-11-09 WP3 motion gateway

Commands are in evidence/wp3/wp3.sh. Integration uses `scripts/test_motion_gateway.py` against `start_sim.sh mock`.

| Check | Result | Evidence / scope |
|---|---|---|
| coordinator build and pytest | PASS | 01, 02; 101 tests |
| Mock run 1 | FAIL | 04a, 05a; reported PASS, but the contact-path collision check was refused by IK, so it did not test collision |

| Cancel during motion | PASS | stopped mid-move and stayed still on mock |
| Gazebo physics, hardware | NOT_RUN | mock joints follow commands exactly |

## 2026-11-09 WP2 ROS-free task logic

| Check | Result | Evidence / scope |
|---|---|---|
| `colcon build --packages-select dual_arm_coordinator` | PASS | 01_build.log |

Three older evidence files overwritten by build.sh and the pipeline were restored from git.

## 2026-11-09 WP0 baseline

Commit c7dfba3, WSL Ubuntu, no source changes. Commands are in evidence/roadmap_baseline/wp0.sh.

| Check | Result | Evidence / scope |

| Sanitizers | NOT_RUN | outside WP0 |
| All hardware checks | NOT_RUN | |

The first attempt did not run the build because `wsl.exe` expanded the shell variables; see roadmap_baseline/README.md. Eight older evidence files overwritten by these scripts were restored from git.

## 2026-11-09 Far-side simulation layout

Commands ran in WSL Ubuntu after `generate_cad_robot.py`, `generate_world.py` and `scripts/build.sh`. Both generators were first run unmodified and reproduced the committed model and world. Prior evidence is in evidence/before_far_side_layout_20261109. The first background run never started, because Git Bash rewrote the `/mnt/c` script path and a pipe hid the failure with exit 0; its stale files were not used. It was rerun with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`, and file times and values were checked afterward.

| Check | Result | Evidence / scope |
|---|---|---|
| `test_cad_pose.py` | PASS | cad_pose_validation.json; 264 visuals match source CAD plus the documented layout transform; does not show the layout matches hardware |
| `verify_model_revision.py` | PASS | model_revision_validation.json; motor axes and TCP unchanged |
| `report_home_poses.py` | PASS | home_poses.json; FK and limits; j1 direction -1 is inferred |
| `check_home_collision.py` | PASS | home_collision.json; discrete self/inter-arm boxes only; world and path NOT_RUN |
| `test_ik.py` | FAIL | ik_validation.json; 16/18; arm1 (0.2, -0.085) and arm2 slot 1 (-0.1675, -0.09), the mirrored equivalents of the two previous failures |
| `measure_slot_adjustment.py` baseline | FAIL | slot_adjustment.json; slot 1 at 30 mm above contact |
| `verify_slot_proposals.py` | PASS | slot_proposal_verification.json; candidates +Y 6 mm, +X 18 mm, +Y 10 mm; solver self-consistency only |
| `check_slot_self_collision.py` | PASS | slot_self_collision.json; 0/248 invalid for each candidate; URDF boxes only |
| coordinator unit tests | PASS | 8 tests |
| `smoke_runtime.py sim --seconds 150 --group both_arms --execute` | PASS | sim_runtime.json; cameras, views, controllers, plan, execution feedback and shutdown |
| `analyze_sim_images.py` | FAIL for env grid only | sim_detection.json; arm1 8 caps and arm2 grid PASS; env finds 4 caps and 4 holes because the arms occlude it, unchanged from the previous record |
| `validate_sim_coordinates.py` | PASS (measurement) | sim_coordinate_validation.json; max error env 1.93 mm, arm1 1.09 mm, arm2 0.53 mm; calibration validity NOT_RUN |
| `tf2_echo armN_base_link armN_base` | PASS | far_side_checks.log; translation (0, 0, 0.014), yaw 90 deg |
| `run_pipeline.sh --count 2` | PASS | transfer_pipeline.json, far_side_pipeline.log; 74 events; Gazebo ground truth to slots 3 and 4 |

`check_slot_mesh_witnesses.py` was not rerun. Eight-object transfer, vision-driven transfer, world collision, continuous path and all hardware checks remain NOT_RUN.

## 2026-11-09 Live ROS graph capture

At commit b48eee8, headless `vision_sim.launch.py` plus `calibration.launch.py` ran on domain 77 and the graph was dumped with rclpy (evidence/ros_graph_vision_sim). Node, topic, service and action endpoints PASS against the source, and all three controllers were active. The first capture attempt never started because the capture script used `set -u` before sourcing ROS. `arm1_controller`'s spawner exited 1 after its first switch call timed out at 10 s and the retry found the controller already switched; the controller was active. `/vision/calibration_status` content NOT_RUN: `ros2 topic echo --once` got nothing within 15 s and the cause was not investigated. `arm2_vision_node` and `calibration_status` logged tracebacks during SIGINT shutdown, after the capture. No leftover processes. This shows endpoints exist, not that data or task flow is correct.

## 2026-11-09 README screenshots

docs/images comes from a two-object headless run at commit 6feea97, which reached PASS with 74 events. The first capture attempt never started the transfer because Gazebo's controller switch timed out after 120 s, while the capture script polled `list_controllers`; delaying the first poll by 45 s worked on the retry. One retry does not establish the cause, so treat this as an intermittent startup failure. transfer_pipeline.json was restored after the capture.

## 2026-11-09 Fresh GitHub clone check

Commit e345638 FAIL on a fresh clone (clone_build_check.log): `dual_arm_bringup` installed an empty `config` directory that git does not store. Removing that install entry gave 11 packages built, 33 cm530_hardware tests, coordinator tests and `start_sim.sh mock`, all PASS in a clone with the one-line fix. The earlier README flow check missed this because `tar` preserves empty directories.

## 2026-11-09 README flow check

The README steps were followed in a throwaway copy on the WSL Linux disk (readme_flow_check.log): copy 434 s and 578 MB, full build of 11 packages 300 s, then quick checks, 33 cm530_hardware tests, the mock-serial launch and `start_sim.sh mock`, all PASS. `install_jazzy.sh` was not rerun because the packages were already installed; its list was compared against the package dependency closure. All required ROS packages exist in the arm64 Jazzy repository, but an Orin build remains NOT_RUN.

## 2026-11-09 cm530_hardware on mock serial

Commands ran in WSL Ubuntu. The mock compiles the unmodified v17 firmware parser and AX-12 driver; only the motor bus and serial timing are simulated.

| Check | Result | Evidence / scope |
|---|---|---|
| `colcon build` of cm530_hardware, description, bringup | PASS | cm530_build.log; -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wconversion -Werror on project code |
| Unit tests (protocol, calibration, firmware-loop link and scheduler) | PASS | cm530_unit_tests.log; 33 tests |
| ASan + UBSan + LeakSanitizer, 20 repetitions | PASS | cm530_sanitizers.log |
| TSan, 20 repetitions | PASS | cm530_sanitizers.log; first attempt aborted at startup on the WSL mapping limit, rerun with `setarch -R` |
| `scripts/test_cm530_mock.py` | PASS | cm530_mock_integration.json; read-only, refused calibration, null template, missing tolerances, trajectory and mid-run link loss |
| URDF plugin selection in mock, sim, hardware and default modes | PASS | xacro output only; Gazebo was not rerun after this URDF edit |
| Real UART, motors, loop rate, Orin | NOT_RUN | No board connected |
| c-review security workflow | NOT_RUN | Its Workflow tool is unavailable in this environment |

## 2026-11-09 raw-512 zero mapping

Commands ran in WSL Ubuntu from `dual_arm_ws`.

| Check | Result | Evidence / scope |
|---|---|---|
| `bash scripts/build.sh` | PASS | colcon_build.log, model_validation.log; 10 packages |
| Coordinator unit tests | PASS | coordinator_zero512_tests.log; 8 tests |
| `scripts/report_home_poses.py` | PASS | home_poses.json; FK and limits only, simulation-assumed mapping |
| `scripts/check_home_collision.py` | PASS | home_collision.json; discrete self/inter-arm boxes, world and path NOT_RUN |
| Two-object A->B->C regression | PASS | transfer_pipeline.json, zero512_pipeline.log; Gazebo ground truth, headless, 74 events. cap_5 and cap_6 ended within 0.01 mm XY of their C targets |
| Simulation shutdown | FAIL | zero512_launch.log; launch still running 45 s after SIGINT, Gazebo stopped by SIGTERM |
| Arm 1 j1 zero | BLOCKED | Needs motor 17 readings on the real arm; 192.3 is a simulation placeholder |
| Hardware calibration, directions, wrist clearance | NOT_RUN | Hardware remains disabled |

A first collision attempt failed before running because the test command overrode PYTHONPATH and hid rclpy; it was rerun without the override. `transfer_pipeline.json` holds `FAIL` until a run completes, so a mid-run read is not a result.

## 2026-11-09 revision results

- `model_revision_validation.json`: PASS, ten prescribed component transforms, unchanged motor axes/TCP, eight white pads flush at 14 mm.
- `coordinator_revision_tests.log`: eight tests PASS, including HOME missing/invalid inputs and signed conversion.
- `home_named_states_build.log`: two affected packages built successfully after HOME named-state generation.
- `solidworks_standalone.log`: corrected geometry SLDPRT saved and reopened, 342 solid bodies, warnings=0. Not proof of original parametric mates or portable imported SLDASM references.
- Old three-object pipeline PASS is historical. Revised geometry / assumed HOME / 50% transport workflow is still undergoing runtime validation. Latest startup readiness failure is recorded, not counted as motion success.

All below refers to earlier component measurements unless explicitly regenerated.

These results cover separate components and measurements. Overall complete-system acceptance is **NOT_RUN**; the latest simulation runtime probe is **FAIL** because Gazebo shutdown fails. No hardware calibration or physical acceptance is claimed.

| Check | Recorded result | Evidence / scope |
|---|---|---|
| CAD source-pose transforms | PASS | evidence/cad_pose_validation.json; exported source pose, not dynamics |
| Original vision tests | PASS | evidence/vision_tests.log; 99 tests |
| Calibration validity and held-out plane checker | PASS | evidence/calibration_suite.log; 10 tests; no physical calibration |
| Mock controllers, MoveIt planning and shutdown | PASS | evidence/mock_runtime.json |
| Simulation both_arms small joint execution and feedback | PASS | evidence/sim_runtime.json; not A→B→C |
| Simulation shutdown | FAIL | evidence/sim_launch.log; Gazebo escalates to SIGTERM |
| Three camera streams and four views | PASS | evidence/sim_runtime.json; fixed simulation camera mounts |
| Suction isolated attachment/release physics | PASS | evidence/suction_physics.json; simple fixture, not dual-arm transfer |
| Suction policy sanitizers | PASS | evidence/gripper_sanitizers.log; policy test only |
| Saved slot-proposal FK and limits | PASS | evidence/slot_proposal_verification.json; 744 discrete points across three candidates |
| Proposal conservative-box self-collision | FAIL | evidence/slot_self_collision.json; −Y 7 mm: 49/248 invalid; −Y 10 mm and +X 19 mm: each 62/248 invalid |
| Selected CAD mesh surface witnesses | NOT_RUN (full clearance acceptance) | evidence/slot_mesh_witnesses.json; six representative states checked, no surface crossings found; containment and whole trajectory not covered |
| Full eight-object transfer and placement | NOT_RUN | Runtime coordinator, scene and validated target pipeline incomplete |
| CM530 / ESP32 / real cameras | NOT_RUN | Hardware disabled |

Saved-image coordinate measurements in evidence/sim_coordinate_validation.json are not calibration authorization. CameraInfo-derived maximum XY errors were approximately 1.97 mm (environment, 4 caps), 1.16 mm (arm1, 8 caps), and 1.61 mm (arm2, 8 holes). Four-point fitted homographies with four unused points in the same static scene reduce maximum held-out errors to approximately 0.17 mm and 0.09 mm for arm1 and arm2. Independent acquisition, timestamp/TF provenance and the measured combined error budget are still missing, so operational calibration remains NOT_RUN.

Reproduce the slot checks in WSL from the workspace:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_slot_proposals.py
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
python3 scripts/check_slot_self_collision.py  # expected exit 1 for recorded collisions
python3 scripts/check_slot_mesh_witnesses.py prepare
.cad-venv/bin/python scripts/check_slot_mesh_witnesses.py inspect
```

The collision query launches an isolated mock graph and sends state-validity requests only. It uses installed URDF/SRDF and verifies installed URDF bytes match source. Evidence includes model and input hashes. Rebuild if source and installed model differ.
